        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.Popular because:\n",
        "  -Easy syntax (like English),\n",
        "  -Large community and libraries,its Versatility(used in web, data science, automation, etc.)\n",
        "  -An example code in python print(\"Hello, Python!\") Which is Simple and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine instructions.\n",
        "  - This allows for quick testing and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words that Python uses for its syntax and structure. You can't use them for variable names or functions.\n",
        "  - examples:if,else,for,while,def,class,return,True,false,None\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No,We can't use keywords as variable names causes a syntax error because they have predefined roles.\n",
        "  - An sample code:\n",
        "  - code:-class =\"Math\" x which is invalid because 'class' is a reserved keyword.\n",
        "  The above code is wrong to fix it,we just use a non-keyword name for the vairable.The correct code is\n",
        "  - code:-Subject =\"Math\" #valid\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability refers to wheter an object' Content can be changed after its Created.                               \n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Mutable objects:Lists,dictionaries,sets\n",
        "  - Immutable objects: Tuples, Strings, integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  -Lists are Designed for dynamic data-you can add,remove, or change elements.Tuples are fixed collections,often used for data that shouldn't change.\n",
        "  Example:-The below codes is an example of the Lists and Tuples.The first one below is the Lists and second one is Tuples.\n",
        "  -  1.my_list = [1, 2, 3] # A list with 3 elements\n",
        "  - my_list[0] = 10     # Changing the first element to 10\n",
        "  - print(my_list).     #  Output: [10,2,3].\n",
        "  - In the above code You can u update,add,remove items in an certain list.Lists are good when your data needs to change.\n",
        "  - The below code is an example for the tuples which are immutable\n",
        "  This means you cannot cahnge their elements once created.\n",
        "  - my_tuple =(1,2,3)  #This is an tuple with 3 elements\n",
        "  - my_tuple[0]= 10    # x This will raise a Typerror.\n",
        "  - The Above code is an example of Tuples which are Immutable Because,Tuples are fixed and cannot be modified.They are useful when you want to protect data from being changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  - The \"==\" operator checks if two Variables Have the same value.It compares the contents of the objects.Use \"==\"when you want to compare Values.\n",
        "  - The \"is\" Operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.It Compares the identity of the objects.use \"is\" when you want to check if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "  - An example code for the above operators is\n",
        "  -\n",
        "  a= [1,2,3]\n",
        "    \n",
        "  b= [1,2,3]\n",
        "  \n",
        "  a==b  #True,Because both lists have the same values.\n",
        "  a is b # False,Because they are two diffent objects in memory.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -Here,This operators checks:\n",
        "  Do both lists have the same values?\n",
        "  yes- both have[1,2,3]\n",
        "  so,a==b is True.\n",
        "  Are a and b the exact same object in memory?\n",
        "  No- They are two diffent lists stored in diffent memory locations so,a is b is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "  - Logical Operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value(True or False).Python has three main logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - and - Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - or  - Returns True if at least one condtions is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - not - Reverses the Result(i.e.,True becomes False,and Vice versea).\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python\n",
        "  - Type Casting means Converting one data type into another,Like from string to integer or float.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "  - Implicit: Python automatically converts types.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  x =5 + 3.0 # Result is 8.0\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Explicit: You Manually Convert using functions like int(),float(),str().\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  y = float(7) # Converts integer to float - 7.0\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "  - Conditional Statements allow Your Program to Make decisions based on conditions.\n",
        "  - Example: age=18\n",
        "             if age >= 18:\n",
        "             print(\"You are adult\") # Output is your an adult.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work\n",
        "  - Elif stands for \"else if\" and used to check another condition if the first if False.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "  Score= 75\n",
        "   if score >= 90:\n",
        "      print(\"A Grade\")\n",
        "   elif score >= 70:\n",
        "      print(\"B Grade\")\n",
        "   else:\n",
        "      print(\"C Grade\").\n",
        "  # Output will be \"B Grade\".\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - For loop: Used when you know how many times to repeat.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Code:\n",
        "  for i in range(3):\n",
        "       print(i) # 0,1,2\n",
        "\n",
        "- While loop:Used when you repeat until a condition becomes False.\n",
        "   Code:i = 0\n",
        "while i < 5:\n",
        "    print(i)\n",
        "    i += 1\n",
        "  # Output prints 0 to 4 numbers,based on the condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n",
        "   - Use whule when you dont know how many times looop will run.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "              password =\" \"\n",
        "              while passowrd !=\"admin\"\n",
        "              password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   - This loop keeps runing intil the correct passoword by the user is enterd correct passowrd is entered - perfect for while.\n",
